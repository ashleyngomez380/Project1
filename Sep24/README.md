So here we have the file called all of these have random gaussian noice

fourtyfourweeks . This is a synthetic dataset that shows normal 44 week parttern with a day being
96 points and we having 5 high peaks then 2 low peaks
This size is 29568

Onetotentype1 is a npy array that has a occurance of 10:1 with 10 high peaks followed with a low peak again a day 
being 96 points repeated 10 times
This is size 10560

Random_100_days_with_10_type_1 is as the name implies a npy.array with 100 days randoly assignmed as type 1 or type 2 still
we have a bias so type 1 is likely to occurs 10 times more than type 2 . Type 1 tall sin curve Type2 small sin curve
This size is 9600
