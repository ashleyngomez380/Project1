Test Cases 94 Follow this notation and principal 
𝑇 (𝑥) = 𝐴1 sin( 1/2𝑥 + 𝜋) + 𝐴2 sin(2𝑥 − 𝜋) (3) where we construct the following datasets to cover three different cases:
• Low-Frequency Priority (LPF): The energy in the low frequency is two times that of the high frequency (i.e. 𝐴1 = 2𝐴2).
• High-Frequency Priority (HPF): The energy in the high frequency is two times that of the low frequency (i.e. 𝐴2 = 2𝐴1).
• Equal Frequency Priority (EPF): The energy in both frequencies is equal (i.e. 𝐴1 = 𝐴2).
